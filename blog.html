                        We are living in a <a href="https://themedium.ca/on-retrofuturism-and-our-culture-of-convenience/">‘culture of convenience’</a> and nowhere is that clearer than online where it seems every site is designed to maximise attention and profit. It can be hard not to be constantly asking oneself “ok, what am I being sold here?” and I don’t just mean commercial products either — ideologies, brands, personas we are being subtly manipulated into ‘buying’. Perhaps this is not something we can truly escape. The fantasy of the early internet as something utopic and innocent is, of course, a fantasy that diminishes the way that the internet, from its very first days, was a site for serious political and artistic statements to be made. Now, the internet — and social media sites in particular — are regarded more as neutral vessels for information, with the capacity for information to be spread far and wide being the main draw.
                        <br> 
                        <br>   
                        Early internet art and activism explicitly manipulated and distorted the medium itself in order to further its message. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_bombing#:~:text=Google%20bombing%2C%20also%20known%20as%20Google%20washing%2C,of%20web%20pages%20for%20relevant%20search%20terms.">Google bombing</a> was one of the earliest and most effective forms of internet activism, wherein users manipulate Google’s search engine optimization in order to make certain pages show up as answers to queries. Google bombing was often used to attack unpopular political figures, such as President George Bush’s Wikipedia page showing up when one googled ‘miserable failure’. A similar strategy was used by groups such as the Electronic Disturbance Theater who developed a tool called <a href="https://anthology.rhizome.org/floodnet">Floodnet</a> to clog the oppressive Mexican government’s pages with error messages proclaiming words of protest. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                            The internet lends itself well to collective action as people around the world are able to connect over shared interests and passions. The medium of the blog is a powerful vessel of self-expression — a diary that can stretch over the whole planet, as though the user’s consciousness were itself extended. The terror of vulnerability is softened by the internet’s anonymity. Users are given a unique opportunity to express themselves in their entirety without shame. Do we trust the internet more now than we did back then? Should we? Do we trust each other?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A consistent critique of the internet is that it is ruining people’s attention spans by making them too used to instant gratification and several stimuli at once. Perhaps the real worry is the increase in automation which, in the words of critic Walter Benjamin* , fundamentally devalues the work’s aura. The pleasure in clicking through a site — such as Olia Lialina’s striking artwork <a href="http://www.teleportacia.org/war/">“My Boyfriend Came Back from the War”</a> — and discovering every nook and cranny of a site exposes its beauty. A huge part of Lialina’s work is the dissonance of its concurrent text and image. The work (while minimalistic in its simple black-and-white text and pixel art) is heavily layered and hard to take in without dedicated time and attention.

                        <br>
                        Our culture of convenience is borne out of a willful ignorance and it perpetuates this ignorance with every passing year. Active engagement with the internet’s ‘backend’ and a willingness to be weird with it is the only way to escape this. Do it by hand, do it badly and slowly. The kitty cat named sunshine and rainbows was my third attempt at ASCII art which is a medium based principally in fiddling around and seeing what works. The product I finally completed — a cat playing with a ball of yarn — sat over my blog like a totem, encouraging me in my own playing and exploration.
